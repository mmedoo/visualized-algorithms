                <li>
                    The OpenSet object would be a lot more optimized if implemented with ordered dictionary from Python.
                    The ordered dictionary uses a doubley linked list to store the order in which properties were added to the object.
                    By sorting this list and putting newly added cells in the right order,
                    the retrieval of the cell with lowest F score would have constant time complexity O(1). In our case, the retrieval complexity is O(N).
                    Putting the newly added cells in the right order has a worst case complexity of O(N), but the point is that It's a worst case scenario
                    not everytime scenario as the case in a regualr function of retrieving the minimum value.

                <br>
                <li>
                    I used to compare between the neighbour cell with lowest F score to corresponding one from OpenSet,
                    and If the neighbouring one is lower, I would connect it to the current path and avoid redrawing the whole path again as an optimization,
                    then I found it not worth the mess caused to the code so I made it redraw the new path everytime for more simplicity.
